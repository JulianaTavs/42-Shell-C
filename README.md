### This is a brief summary about each exercise completed by me during my participation in the 42 Piscine(42 programming school).

Shell00 : Learning how to manipulate files and directories using commands on the Bash: cat, ls, cd, pwd, touch, mkdir, chmod, rm, ln, diff, patch, find. Also learning how to work with **magic numbers** and how to manipulate bytes.
